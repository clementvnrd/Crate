Crate includes a built-in audio player for previewing tracks. Use it to audition music without leaving the application.

## Player Location

The player appears at the bottom of the Crate window. It shows:

- **Track artwork** - Album cover of the current track
- **Track info** - Title and artist
- **Progress bar** - Current position and total duration
- **Controls** - Play, pause, stop

## Playing a Track

### Double-Click

The simplest way to play a track:

1. Find the track in the library or a playlist
2. Double-click the track row
3. Playback starts immediately

### Context Menu

1. Right-click on a track
2. Select **Play**

## Player Controls

### Play/Pause

Toggle playback with:
- Click the **Play/Pause** button in the player
- Press **Space** on your keyboard (when not in a text field)

### Stop

Click the **Stop** button to halt playback and clear the current track.

### Seek

To jump to a different position in the track:
- **Click** anywhere on the progress bar to jump to that position
- **Drag** the playhead to scrub through the track

### Volume

Adjust playback volume with the volume slider in the player.

## Next Track, Shuffle and Missing Files

### What plays next

Next and previous (and continuous playback at the end of a track) walk the list you started playback from, **as it is displayed**: while you stay on that view and playlist, a search, a filter or a new sort order changes what comes next. Once you go to another view or playlist, Crate keeps walking the list as you left it.

With shuffle on, every track of the list plays once before any track repeats, and **Previous** goes back through the tracks you actually heard, wherever you started them from (a row, the suggestions, Duplicate Killer, the Upgrader, or the track restored at launch). Album mode follows the same shuffle toggle.

- **Previous with nothing to go back to** (shuffle, first track of the session) restarts the current track.
- **A one-track list** replays its track, with shuffle on or off.

### A file that cannot be loaded

When the next track's file was moved, deleted or is on a drive that is not connected, Crate skips it, plays the following one and shows one message naming the skipped track. The track is flagged as missing in the library and is never counted as played. The track that is playing is never interrupted by a file that fails to load.

If 10 tracks in a row cannot be loaded (or every other track of a shorter list), Crate stops trying and shows a single error: check that the drive holding your music is connected.

## Now Playing Display

When a track is playing, the player shows:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Artwork | Album cover (if available) |
| Title | Track name |
| Artist | Performer |
| Progress | Current time / Total time |

The currently playing track is also highlighted in the track list.

## Audio Device Selection

Choose which audio output device Crate uses for playback:

1. Open **Settings** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)
2. Go to the **Sound** tab
3. Select your preferred output device
4. Close settings

Changes take effect for the next track played.

### Available Devices

Crate detects:
- Built-in speakers/headphones
- USB audio interfaces
- Bluetooth audio devices
- Virtual audio devices

If a device is disconnected during playback, audio will stop. Reconnect the device and resume playback.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Play/Pause | `Space` |

More playback shortcuts may be added in future updates.

## Tips

### Quick Previews

Use the player for quick auditions:
1. Browse your library
2. Double-click to preview
3. Move to the next track when ready

### Device Setup for DJing

If using Crate alongside DJ software:
1. Route Crate to a separate output (e.g., headphones)
2. Keep your main output for DJ software
3. Preview tracks in Crate without affecting your mix

### Troubleshooting

**No sound?**
- Check the volume slider in the player
- Verify the correct output device is selected in Settings
- Ensure your system volume is up
- Try selecting a different audio device

**Audio stutters or crackles?**
- Close other audio applications
- Try a different audio device
- Restart Crate
